Climate, Environment, and Society concentration 

I majored in Data Analytics in my undergrad so I've worked quite a bit with Python... hoping this course is a nice segue into learning about GIS!

Project Ideas:
1. Explore migration patters of filipino communities after housing evictions from Manilatown in SF in the 70s. What environmental injustices are these communities facing in these neighborhoods, if any?
2. Heat equity 
3. Clean energy and water supply tradeoffs
